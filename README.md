# weather_dashboard
A simple weather dashboard using OpenWeather APIs

## To Do

* add current weather report being save to local storage - or do local weathe



## Ideas / To Do / Bugs

* Ask for current location on first load, use that to fill in weather information

## Done

 * when the ajax call fails, the search item is no longer saved in local storage

 * When running main query off of saved search button it saves that city into local storage again

* write a script that checks if there is another item that is exactly the same in the local storage array and not print another button if there is (possibly inside update and/or render array function?)
